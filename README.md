## Visualization

The line plot shows the average number of fatalities by day of the year in the United States. Fatalities are lowest in the early months (Januaryâ€“March), rise steadily through spring, and peak in the summer around July 4th. After summer, fatalities gradually decline but spike again around late December (likely due to holiday travel and New Year's celebrations). A vertical dashed line highlights April 20th (4/20), falling within the spring increase, but it does not show an unusually sharp spike compared to surrounding days.
